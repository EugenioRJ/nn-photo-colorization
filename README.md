Can neural networks help bring a colourful life back to old black and white photos? Let's check it out!

Inspired, by [Emil Wallner's](https://twitter.com/EmilWallner) Medium post titled *["How to colorize black & white photos with just 100 lines of neural network code"](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/colorize-b-w-photos-with-a-100-line-neural-network-53d9b4449f8d)*, I decided to delve into the field myself, and see what I might end up with.
